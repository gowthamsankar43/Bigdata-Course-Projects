Post Office Data Analysis using Hive

 Problem Scenario:
			Philips works as a data analyst for PwC and has been 
delegated to another country since the government is looking to make some 
significant economic changes, which could mean a lot of work for PwC. The 
Philips team was recently invited to the PM's office and informed that the PM 
wants to completely revamp the post offices of the country he has been 
delegated to because they have the greatest reach to every corner of the 
country. The revamping will begin in any state, and if the response is positive, it 
will be spread across the country. The PM's vision is to give every post office the 
power of banking, allowing people to open accounts, deposit money, and take 
advantage of schemes. As the leader, Philips chooses a state as the PoC state. 
You must assist Philips in completing the analysis.
